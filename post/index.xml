Symptoms look rather weird: arecord doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop recording after a period of time specified by --duration flag, but keeps running and writing garbage to files like *-01.wav, *-02.wav and so on. Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give any solution to this (except the recommendation of terminating arecord using killall -KILL arecord after certain period of time).</description></item><item><title>Calibration of MAX31855 thermocouple converter</title><link>https://nagimov.me/post/max31855-thermocouple-to-digital-converter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 17:55:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nagimov.me/post/max31855-thermocouple-to-digital-converter/</guid><description>I have recently spent some time playing with Maxim 31855 chips, in a need of precise and cheap K-type thermocouple logger. It is a cheap voltage amplifier with digital SPI interface, so it works perfectly well with Raspberry Pi or Arduino.
There are many thermocouple amplifiers out there, and I am sure that most of them are properly calibrated for the temperature range around +/-50C, since even linear volt-to-degreeC conversion works fine in that range.</description></item><item><title>Amazon Fire TV 2nd Gen - Root &amp; OpenVPN</title><link>https://nagimov.me/post/fire-tv-2nd-gen-root-openvpn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 19:35:32 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nagimov.me/post/fire-tv-2nd-gen-root-openvpn/</guid><description>My notes after spending half a day playing with my Fire TV.
While Amazon Fire TV seems to be the best htpc solution to me, it still requires rooting and a bit of patching on its way to a decent media center. I&amp;rsquo;m also used to US streaming services (Pandora, Netflix, Hulu, etc) which are only available through VPN, if you are outside of US. Rooting and setting up Kodi + OpenVPN is a way to go.</description></item></channel></rss>
